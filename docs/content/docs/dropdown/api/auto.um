@prototype hx.Dropdown
  @bugfix 0.12.8
    @description
      Updated the z-index checking so that it gets the highest of all the parent z-index, not just the closest parent's z-index.

  @bugfix 1.15.0
    @issue 227
    @issue 228
    @issue 229
    @description
      Fixed a bug with the dropdown positioning logic.

  @updated 2.2.0
    @description
      Removed the animation from the show/hide for dropdowns. The showstart/showend etc. events will be deprecated in a minor release and removed in the next major release.

      Also converted the dropdown to reposition whenever the content is updated to prevent overlap or overflow outside the window area. Uses @hyperlink(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)[MutationObserver]

  @fix nextReleaseVersion
    @description
      Resolved an issue where the dropdown would overlap for themes with non-zero @code[--dropdown-spacing] value.

    @arg selector [String/HTMLElement]

    @arg dropdownContent [String/Function]
      @updated 2.0.0
        @description
          Dropdown content now supports being passed a @code[Selection] that will be automatically appended to the dropdown content.

          @notice String content
            A warning is shown when passing in string content due to the deprecation of @code[Selection::html]. It is still possible to pass in
            a string which will continue to work when this function is updated to use @code[Selection::text].

      @description
        The content to fill the dropdown with. It can be either a string or a function that is passed the dropdown node. An example string content could be:

    @arg? mode [String]
      @description
        The type of action that will show the dropdown, can be 'click' or 'hover' (the hover value will act as click for mobile devices without the hover event)

      @default
        'click'

    @arg? align [String]
      @description
        The alignment value for the dropdown. The complete list of all alignment properties that should be used can be seen below:

        Aside from 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right', the other values use the first two characters to select a corner from the selection and the second two characters to select a corner from the dropdown and then align those corners so they are closest to each other.

      @default

    @arg? spacing [Number]
