      @item: @code[modalCenter]
      @item: @code[modalRight]
      @item: @code[modalFullScreen]

  @method isOpen
    @description
      Returns the current open state of the Modal

    @returns Boolean
      @description
        Whether the modal is open

  @method isOpen
    @description
      Set the open state of the modal (and animate if changing state)

    @arg open [Boolean]
      @description
        Whether the modal should be open.

    @arg? callback [Function]
      @description
        The function to call when the modal has been shown/hidden and the animation has completed.

  @method show
    @description
      Shows the modal.

      Alias for @code[isOpen(true)]

    @arg? callback [Function]
      @description
        The function to call when the modal has been shown and the animation is complete.

    @returns Modal
      @description
        Returns this Modal

  @method hide
    @description
      Shows the modal.

      Alias for @code[isOpen(true)]

    @arg? callback [Function]

        The function to call when the modal has been hidden and the animation is complete.

    @returns Modal

  @method close
    @description
      The function called by the close button and when the user presses 'Escape' for modals that show the close button.

      The default action will be to call @code[hide] immediately. Providing @code[options.onClose] will override this and call
      the provided method instead, allowing the close action to be intercepted without closing the modal.

    @arg? callback [Function]
      @description
        The function to call when the modal has been hidden and the animation is complete.

  @method render
    @description
      A method to update the content of a modal using the @code[renderBody] and @code[renderFooter] options.

      This is called whenever the modal transitions from closed to open.

      This is useful when the data rendered in the modal needs to be redrawn after the source data has been updated.
