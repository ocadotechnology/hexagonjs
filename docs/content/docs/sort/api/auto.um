        as a string.

    @description
      A function to compare two items and return a number based on the priority.
      It takes into account the character order of text and the numeric order of numbers, as opposed to a standard text sort.

    @description
      A function to return a localised sort function to use directly when calling array.sort.

      It takes into account the character order of text for a specific locale and the numeric order of numbers.

      Some browsers don't support the @code[locale] and @code[options] parameters.

      Browser support and accepted values for the @code[locale] and @code[options] parameters can be found on the
