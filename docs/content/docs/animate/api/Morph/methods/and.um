    Adds an action that should happen concurrently with the previous action

    @description
      The named morph to use.

  @arg? duration [Number]
    @description
      The length of the animation in milliseconds

    @default: 200

  @returns Animation

  @arg fn [Function]
    @description
      A function that gets called as part of the chain. If this function
      returns an @type[EventEmitter], the behaviour is to wait for that event
      emitter to emit an 'end' event before proceeding to the next step.

      Anything that is returned from this function that has a 'cancel' method
      will be called.

    @arg? done [Function]
      @description
        If specified in the argument list, this action will only complete when
        this function is called to complete the action.

        If this is not specified in the argument list the function will be
        called synchronously (ie it will block).

        The later option is useful for cleanup at the end of a morph.

  @returns Morph
    @description
      This @type[Morph] for chaining.
