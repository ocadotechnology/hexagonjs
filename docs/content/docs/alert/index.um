  @topic About
    Alerts and messages are essentially the same, with messages being a sub-type of alerts.
    The key difference between messages and alerts is that messages will auto-dismiss themselves
    after a set duration and do not show a close button, while alert will persist on screen until
    the close button is clicked. Both @code[message] and @code[alert] return an @code[Alert] and have
    the same methods available.

    Messages should be used to show information that is useful for the user to know, but isnâ€™t critical, or too complex.
    The best example of success message stating a task was completed successfully. Without the message the user will
    not know if the system was able to complete the task. If the user finds they need to dismiss the message and it is too
    distracting to the workflow, this is a good case to use message instead of alert.
