    @version 0.9.0
      @description
        This release mainly consists of the standardisation of the colour classes
        across all the modules, converting things like @code[hx-btn-positive]
        to @code[hx-positive] and converting from light/dark to
        compliment/contrast to make the theming of hexagon easier.

        The numbered color classes for each module have also been deprecated in
        favour of the named classes: hx-positive, hx-warning, hx-negative, hx-info,
        hx-compliment, hx-contrast. The classes have been deprecated in this
        version and will be removed in a later version.

        All references to @code[hx.Collapseable] (and similarly mispelt
        collapseables) have been deprecated in favor of the correct spelling,
        collapsible.

    @version 0.10.0
      @description
        This release consists of several new modules and features including
        inline editables, inline selects and morphing sections as well as a
        re-styling of the Slider.

        The previously deprecated color classes have also been removed, as well
        as all references to the mis-spelled @code[hx.Collapseable]

    @version 0.11.0
      @description
        This release consists mainly of the standardisation of the setters/getters
        for modules. All the old setters and getters have been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release. The new pattern for getting and setting
        values has changed from this:

        @@codeblock js
          var value = component.getValue()
          component.setValue(100)

        To this:

        @@codeblock js
          var value = component.value()
          component.value(100)

        Another addition are resize events for elements:

        @@codeblock js
          selection.on('resize', function (e) {
            console.log('resized!')
          })

        This change allows graphs, tables and paginator modules to automatically
        redraw when they are resized.

        The graph api has been given legends, zoom with mousewheel, and better
        labels for pie charts.

    @version 0.12.0
      @description
        The default font size has also been reduced in size from 16px to 14px.

        Forms have had some improvements, including form validation that works
        on Safari and better support for disabling inputs.

        Previously deprecated setter and getter methods have also been removed.

    @version 0.12.1
      @description
        Installing hexagon via npm with the --production flag will no longer
        install phantomjs.

        @code[hx.Maps] and @code[hx.Sets] can now deal with objects that
        evaluate to the same value when @code[toString] is called on them.

    @version 0.12.2
      @description
        Improved datepickers and bugfixes.

    @version 0.12.3
      @description
        Style changes and bugfixes. The retain parameter for selection.on has
        also been deprecated.

    @version 0.12.4
      @description
        Added @code[form.component(property)] to the Form Builder as a method of
        getting the component for a property of the form (e.g. a tag input). As
        part of this process, components stored in the 'extras' object have been
        removed and are no longer accessible with
        @code[form.properties.get('Name of Property').extras.<componentType>].

        Updated the DatePicker, TimePicker and DateTimePicker to include events
        for when the dropdown is shown/hidden and in the case of the
        DateTimePicker, individual events for when the date or time is changed,
        shown or hidden.

        A bug has been fixed which means that the hexagon builder module should
        no longer throw an error when useCDNs: true is supplied

    @version 0.12.5
      @description
        The time picker (and by extension the date time picker) have had the
        setTime parameter inverted and renamed to retainTime for the date method.
        The default behaviour was changed as if you're using the date method,
        the majority of the times it's used will be setting the entire date/time
        instead of just the date.

    @version 0.12.6
      @description
        All events added by hexagon (using the @code[on] method of event emitters)
        have been namespaced to prevent external events overwriting hexagon
        functionality and vice versa. Events have been namespaced with
        @code[hx.<module-name>], e.g. for the Button Group module:

        @@codeblock js
          element.on('click', 'hx.button-group', function () {
            // handle event
          })

        Added an alternative way of showing nested tabular data
        @hyperlink(/examples/table-in-table-2/)[here].

    @version 0.12.7
      @description
        A new meter component type has been added for displaying progress of
        something.

        Selects and Menus now accept functions that supply the list of items -
        for lazy and dynamically changing data.

    @version 0.12.8
      @description
        Added the SideCollapsible component as well as adding border color
        context classes to the Palette module and the ability to place the x
        axis in a different position on graphs in the Plot module.

        Also updated various components and fixed several bugs caused by internal
        changes to the event emitters.

    @version 0.12.9
      @description
        Fixed some breaking issues with Menu and Pointer Events as well as
        updating the @hyperlink(/examples/morphing-sections-popup/)[Morphing Sections Popup]
        example so it no longer requires overriding styles with !important.

    @version 0.12.10
      @description
        Fixed some more issues with Pointer events as well as adding a new
        ToggleButton class to give a more user friendly API.

        Also added some options to graphs to allow tick markers to be disabled.

    @version 0.13.0
      @description
        This version includes a lot of changes to modules to standardise the
        api's and documentation across all the modules.

        Most of the changes are to constructors, converting from several optional
        arguments to a single options object, or changing module names to be
        consistent (e.g. using @code[items] when setting data instead of
        module-specific names).

        Additional changes include splitting hx.merge into two functions
        (hx.merge and hx.merge.defined), updating events fired for show/hide to
        be consistent and refactoring the internals of the DatePicker, TimePicker
        and DateTimePicker modules.

        Another addition is the @code[suppressed] method as part of event
        emitters. Modules that use the 'on' method now all have the ability to
        have their events suppressed/un-suppressed with this method and modules
        that previously used a function argument to suppress events have had this
        functionality deprecated, to be replaced with the @code[suppressed] method.


    @version 0.14.0
      @description
        Most of the functionality that was deprecated in 0.13.0 has been removed.
        If upgrading to this version from a version earlier than 0.13.0 it is
        recommended that you upgrade to 0.13.0 first to get the deprecation
        warnings - it should make the upgrade easier.

        Other changes are fairly minor, mostly bug fixes. It should be noted
        that the hx.Select component has been renamed to hx.Picker - this is
        to avoid confusion with the selection api, and to avoid name clashing
        in the future.

    @version 0.14.1
      @description
        This release contains several bug fixes. The main fix is for the
        date/time/date-time picker events.

    @version 0.15.0
      @description
        The extended-table module has been deprecated in this release. The
        data-table module is the replacement. The data-table module provides
        mostly the same functionality as the extended table module, but has the
        ability to retain selections when sorting and filtering. Restoration of
        selections is now possible, and the per-column filter input boxes have
        been replaced with a single, easier to use filter box. The data-table
        module also has better support for mobiles - showing the filter and sort
        options at the top of the table when in mobile mode.

        The Select module has been removed in this release - hx.Picker should be
        used instead.

    @version 0.15.1
      @description
        Fix some bugs in extended tables. Fix some deprecated warnings across
        several modules.

    @version 0.15.2
      @description
        The Color and Plot modules have been standardised in this release, with
        a lot of deprecations being made that will be removed in version 1.0.0.

        All the components that allow input in some way can now be disabled using
        the api.

        The hx.ToggleButton prototype has been moved from the Button to its own
        module.

        Several bugfixes have also been made, as well as improving some of the
        general documentation and changelog entries.

    @version 0.15.3
      @description
        Bug fixes. Fix issues with node-sass.

    @version 1.0.0
      @description
        Final standardisation of the api. Features deprecated in the 0.x.x series
        have been removed. From this point on breaking changes are indicated by
        a major version.

        The builder api for hexagon has changed in this version to make theming
        easier. The builder can now export the theme variables in a variety of
        formats (sass, less, stylus, css variables, json, quantum).

    @version 1.0.1
      @description
        An update to the builder to resolve some dependency issues and fix the
        bower config

    @version 1.0.2
      @description
        Fix for the module dependency calculation. If an explicit list of modules
        is included, the build will now include those modules and all the modules
        that they depend on.

    @version 1.0.3
      @description
        Update the build config for the themes to allow the theme fonts to be
        embedded in the css using the @code[embedAssets] option.

    @version 1.0.4
      @description
        Fix several bug fixes that were causing visual issues

    @version 1.1.0

        listen to changes in timezone/locale automatically, added @code[hx.graph]
        as a fluid api version for creating graphs, added @code[hx.text] as a
        new wrapper for @code[hx.request] and made several bugfixes and improvements
        to the underlying code.

        Also added @hyperlink(/guide/printing/)[print styles] to hexagon builds
        as additional resources.

    @version 1.2.0
      @description
        Several enhancements and bugfixes to do with the more commonly used
        components such as View and Data Table as well as additional functionality
        for Form Builder.

        tables take up when in compact mode

        Added some new utility functions for checking the type of values and
        getting the argmin/argmax.

    @version 1.5.1

        previous version.

    @version 1.8.2
      @description
          Fix an issue with the autocomplete and autocomplete picker that caused
          it to break when there are no disabled items to filter.

    @version 1.9.0
      @description
        Resolved an issue caused by the addition of
        @hyperlink(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent)[PointerEvent]
        in Chrome 55+.

        The native @code[PointerEvent] has been disabled in this version
        because of an incompatibility with the Hexagon pointer events. Native
        support will be re-introduced in the next major release.


    @version 1.10.0
      @description
        Resolved some issues with the data table sort/filter.

    @version 1.11.0
      @description
        Fixed an issue where running the tests in a different timezone
        caused them to fail unexpectedly and the associated bug in the timezone
        logic.

        Fixed selections so calling hx.select on a Selection no longer
        shows a warning (and instead performs a no-op)

    @version 1.12.0
      @description
        Some utility methods on @code[Selection] have been added for replacing
        DOM and setting the children of a @code[Selection].

    @version 1.13.0
      @description
        Add several new features and style tweaks based on UX discussion(s)

    @version 1.14.0
      @description
        Deprecated @code[hx.Meter] and fixed a few bugs.

    @version 1.15.0
      @description
        Fixed several issues with IE to provide more support for IE/Edge

    @version 1.16.0
      @description
        Added the ability to use @type[Toggle] in @type[FormBuilder] and the
        ability to disable a @type[Toggle].

        Also fixed a bug where the @type[DatePicker] calendar was incorrectly
        starting on a Sunday instead of Monday as specified in ISO 8601. When
        using @code[moment.js] the week start will still be taken from the
        currently selected locale's week start.

    @version 1.17.0
      @description
        Deprecated a selection of APIs and classes that will be removed in the
        next major release in order to standardize the library and improve
        maintainability.

        Several APIs have been deprecated without a replacement or with
        native JS/ES6 replacements suggested (such as using @code[fetch]
        instead of @code[hx.request]). Making these changes in advance of the
        upcoming major release will make transitioning much easier.

        In addition to the deprecations, multiple features have been added from
        the backlog to further improve the capabilities of the existing
        components. In addition to this, several bugs have also been resolved.

    @version 1.17.1
      @description
        Revert issue 438 to resolve a breaking issue with the Autocomplete Picker
        when using objects as items

        Fix an issue with the form validation that was not correctly handling the
        new form buttons element and add tests

    @version 1.18.1
      @description
        Update the Datepicker to add feature flags for version 2.0.0 to allow for an
        easier migration path.

        Additionally resolve some long standing bugs with Autocomplete and the side
        collapsible

    @version 1.19.0
      @description
        Update the paginator to add feature flags for version 2.0.0 to allow for an
        easier migration path.

    @version 1.20.0
      @description
        Added new button styles, a @code[Badges] module to replace @code[Labels] and
        updated the Error Pages and Layout module in preparation for version 2.0.0.

        Also added parameter replacement, support for plurals and a helper for converting
        multiline text strings to a selection containing multiple 'paragraphs' to the
        @code[hx.userFacingText] function/module.


    @version 2.0.0
      @description
        A breaking change designed to improve the build and internals of Hexagon without
        impacting any of the code or APIs (where possible).

        The core of this includes removing the builder api and replacing with proper modules

        @@codeblock js
          import { DatePicker } from 'hexagon-js';

        See the @hyperlink(/guide/installation/)[Installation] page for more information about
        installing and using Hexagon

        See the @hyperlink(/guide/migration/)[Migration 1.x -> 2.x] page for more information
        about migrating.

        Breaking changes:

        @list
          @item: The @code[build] api for creating a bundle was removed
          @item: @code[ColorPicker] was removed
          @item: @code[hx.theme] replaced by @code[hx.theme()] (find/replace resolves this)


    @version 2.0.1

    @version 2.0.2

    @version 2.0.3
      @description
        Bugfix for TagInput validation in forms

    @version 2.1.0
      @description
        Added support for the @code[Intl] library when working with the preferences and date/time pickers.

        This will be made the default in the next major release and is available under a feature flag:

        @@codeblock js
          hx.preferences.setup({
            featureFlags: {
              useIntlFormat: true,
            },
          })

        This should be done before any other hexagon components are used or created.

        Toggling this enables full IANA timezone (e.g. @code[Europe/London]) and RFC5456 locale (e.g.
        @code[en-GB]) support.

        This will cause the @code[DatePicker], @code[TimePicker] and @code[DateTimePicker] to use the
        @code[Intl] API for localization of the on-screen dates and times instead of the moment.js
        or default (UK English) variant.

        Also added some options to make working with date/time pickers easier.

    @version 2.2.0
      @description
        Updated several components and modules to add new styles and functionality based on UX feedback.

        The new feature flags are:

        @list
          @item: @code[hx-flag-typography] - Updated font styles
          @item: @code[hx-flag-table] - Updated table styles for readability
          @item: @code[hx-flag-tabs] - Updated table styles for readability
          @item: @code[hx-flag-form] - Updated form style (improved layout)
          @item: @code[hx-flag-button] - New button types (primary/secondary etc.)
          @item: @code[hx-flag-tag-input] - Initial tweaks to work with hx-flag-form
          @item: @code[hx-flag-icon] - Use FontAwesome 5 (free) instead of embedded hexagon-icons font

        Resolved an issue with @code[hx.Form] where elements added with @code[addButton] could not be retrieved with @code[.node(...)]

        Also removed the animation from dropdowns to make them feel more responsive and updated them to use @hyperlink(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)[MutationObserver]
        to detect when the content is changed and re-position the dropdown.

    @version nextReleaseVersion
      @description
        Added @code[moreButton] and @code[dropdownButton] as a replacement for the current @code[hx.Menu]
